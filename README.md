# PeerJS React Native


peerjs-react-native is a modified version of [PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs) to allow for use within a React Native application as opposed to a web browser.

[PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs) provides a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer API built on top of WebRTC, supporting both data channels and media streams.

## Setup

**React Native WebRTC**

Ensure that the [react-native-webrtc](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc) package is installed and configured as per their documentation.


**Include the library**

  with npm:
        `npm install peerjs-react-native`
        
  with yarn:
        `yarn add peerjs-react-native`
  ```js
  // The usage -
  import Peer from 'peerjs-react-native';
  // Use the Peer object as you would via normal PeerJS.
  // See documentation links below for reference.
  ```
